# FilmQueryProject

## Description
This Film Query Project is a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data.  It is menu-based allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data. The user is presented with a menu and is given the options to search films via its numeric ID, a search keyword or to quit the program.  Based on the user choice they are prompted to either enter a film ID or search keyword. If the user searched by film ID and the film is found, its title, language, year, rating, description, and a list of actors in its cast are displayed. If the user looks up a film by search keyword they see a list of films, in the previously stated format, for which the search term was found anywhere in the title or description. If the film or films are not found, they see a message saying so and are prompted to try again.
